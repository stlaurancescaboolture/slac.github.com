    <h3><a href="/admin/rules.html">Group Rules</a></h3>
    <p>The HSBNE bible, as it were. Our group rules are a fairly well modified version of the Model Rules for Incorporation. When in doubt, refer to these. Any member is welcome to raise a change to these at a meeting, however it costs HSBNE a nominal fee to re-file.</p>

    <h3><a href="/admin/code.html">Code of Conduct</a></h3>
    <p>The code of conduct is a set of guidelines that outline an acceptable standard of behaviour and conduct of all HSBNE members whether it be online, in a pub or at HSBNE.</p>

    <h3><a href="/admin/safespace.html">Safe Space Policy</a></h3>
    <p>Our Safe Space policy describes the environment of inclusivity and safety that we wish to create for people from all walks of life. HSBNE aims to be an equitable hackerspace.</p>

    <h3><a href="/admin/causes.html">Causes at HSBNE</a></h3>
    <p>Causes are micro groups within HSBNE that are empowered to direct funds towards their own interests without having to convince merit to the group as a whole.</p>

    <h3><a href="/admin/guests.html">Guests at HSBNE</a></h3>
    <p>Clarifications around having guests or non-members at HSBNE.</p>

    <h3><a href="/admin/tickets.html">Tickets at HSBNE</a></h3>
    <p>HSBNE utilises a Ticket system to bring a fleeting sense of control amongst the Chaos. It is recommended you be aware of its usage</p>

    <h3><a href="/admin/dispute.html">Dispute Process</a></h3>
    <p>Disagreements between members are inevitable. Through experience, HSBNE has provided this dispute resolution policy.</p>

    <h3><a href="/admin/policy.html">Policies</a></h3>
    <p>We have a number of non official but enforced guidelines within the group. These are typically the result of a meeting.</p>


    <h3><a href="/admin/costs.html">Ongoing Costs</a></h3>
    <p>The Executive tries to keep any ongoing cost commitments by HSBNE documented here.</p>

    <h3><a href="/admin/exechistory.html">Executive History</a></h3>
    <p>The history of members who have dedicated their time to making HSBNE run.</p>
