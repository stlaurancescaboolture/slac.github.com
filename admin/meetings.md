### HSBNE Meeting Rules
* All discussion for agenda items occurs on the forums in a relevant thread. Meetings are only for announcements, voting, thanks and project invitations/show and tell.
* All agenda items must be posted for discussion by 8PM Thursday the week before the meeting. This allows for discussion before the meeting.
* Before voting on Financial Agenda Items a Financial Report must be either a) read out by the Treasurer or b) provided to be read out.
* One person speaks at a time. No person speaks for more than one minute when others are waiting to speak.
* It's important to thank members who are contributing to HSBNE as we wouldn't be where we are today without it. Take the time in a meeting to thank people for excellence at HSBNE.
