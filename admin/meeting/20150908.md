All agenda items must be posted for discussion by 8PM Thursday the week before the meeting. This allows for discussion before the meeting.
One person speaks at a time. No person speaks for more than one minute when others are waiting to speak.
It's important to thank members who are contributing to HSBNE as we wouldn't be where we are today without it. Take the time in a meeting to thank people for excellence at HSBNE. 24 Voted in favour.
