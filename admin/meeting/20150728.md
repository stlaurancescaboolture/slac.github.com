## Meeting Notes

  - Treasurer's Report: $20,260 in bank, cash flow from membership is at $1200 fro this month, $600 p/month usage approximation for electricity from Mike.  
  - Update on Councillor David Mclachlan, Councillor Tim Nicholls and Headspace visits:  Visits went very well, and they will continue to promote and keep us in the loop with their contacts. 
  - Update on Working Bee:  Colour coding for each cause area, plus removing mezzanine area in machine shop for more room and boneyard clean up.  
  - ABC Article:  Originally, [this](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/) article was published, detailing the ability for penetration hackers to remotely access a Jeep and control radio, engine, etc. The same day we recieved numerous emails asking us to comment.  The ABC posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/34aby0s.png) article referencing HSBNE as an authority on 'hacking' and took a facebook status from Luke Hovington's wall without his permission.  Eventually, after complaints were made they adjusted the article to [make no reference to us](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-22/hackers-warn-smart-car-owners-of-potential-risks/6638784).  In future, it would be much better if we were able to give a response to boost positive publicity. 
  - Toilet Roster: Hamish, timeka, Brendan Hall and Stevie have volunteered. 
  - Security Cameras:  Members can be held accountable if anything is amiss.
