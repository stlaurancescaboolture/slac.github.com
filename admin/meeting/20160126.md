## Meeting Notes

  - Treasurer's Report: $22 K in bank.    
  - Enabling the Future Participation:  This is an organisation allowing 3D printer owners and amputees connect to create custom prosthetics.  5 members volunteered their 3D printers for this cause if HSBNE signed up.  Agreed to sign up.  
  - Shared Toilets/Changes to Lockup Procedure:  Make sure the quad door, front door and door that goes to the toilets are closed and locked if you're the last one out.
  - New Lease KPI's and Classes:  See Colin's post in regards to changing cause requirements.  Agreed to vote on at next meeting. 
  - WSF Update:  Decided to order in bulk strandbeest kits rather than lasercut, and call for volunteers will come out soon. 
  - Craft Punk Update:  Creatorium is now Craft Punk cause, and has had a room makeover.  To keep this standard of cleanliness, all donations etc. will need to be approved by cause leaders.
